I'm thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed the CodePath Intro to Web Development (WEB101) course by fall 2024! 

This journey has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to strengthen my understanding of web development fundamentals and build technical skills that I’m excited to use moving forward. From mastering the basics of HTML and CSS to developing dynamic web functionalities, every moment was a rewarding challenge.

During this 10-week course, I created two projects that I’m proud to share: 
1. Advocacy Project – a web app I built to promote resource sharing for CS community. This website consists navigation bar, simple form validation, parallax scrolling animation, modal, and flex box design which I learned in the course.
2. Personal Preparation Website – a site showcasing the five most important things to me, designed as part of my preparation for the resident advisor application interview.

A huge thank you to the incredible instructors, tech fellows, and peers at CodePath who supported and inspired me throughout this journey. Your guidance made all the difference! 

I’m excited to apply these skills to further enhance my personal website and pursue new projects in the tech development world.
